Other outside guests coming for rooms/hotel inquiry are also next to you. coffee- maybe our choice was not right - South Indian filter coffee frappe was highly recommended by staff. it was sweet, thick, creamy but artificial creaminess type with thickner Or emulsifier.  made with ready frappe mix, didn't enjoy the texture n it was too heavy.

06-03-2024,"My recent visit to this coffee shop left me thoroughly disappointed. Firstly, the lack of seating options was frustrating, and despite the promise of complimentary banana chips and water, none were provided. The rudeness of the waiter further soured the experience. I specifically ordered a cold brew, which they served in glass bottles. However, when I requested to take the bottle with me, the manager refused, leaving me feeling cheated, especially considering the steep price of 300 rupees. Moreover, the lack of basic courtesy, like a simple ""thank you"" after payment, was glaring. Additionally, the excessive amount of ice added to the cold brew made it nearly impossible to enjoy...read more",negative,303.28
