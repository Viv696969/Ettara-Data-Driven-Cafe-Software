# Ettara AI and Data Driven Cafe Software

## Problem Statement
Imagine a bustling coffee shop eager to elevate its game in the highly
competitive market. To achieve this, the problem statement is to harness the
power of data analytics and AI. The coffee shop wishes to revolutionize its
operations, decision-making processes, and customer engagement
strategies. Keep high focus on documentation, git version control, good
coding practices, making a proper ReadMe and so on.


### Core objectives:
1. Insight Extraction: Analyze Customer Reviews and Competitor Data.
- Utilize web scraping techniques to extract user reviews from platforms like Zomato and Swiggy for the Target Restaurant (Ettarra Coffee).
- Analyze customer reviews to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the coffee shop and its competitors.
- Compare and contrast competitors' (Similar restaurants in the region) data to identify areas for improvement and strategic opportunities. Example: If you go to Zomato and search biryanis in the search bar then the top 10 competitors of that region are shown based on the relevance. Now with this competitor basket, curate the summary of how their business is doing.

2. Market Basket Analysis: Understand Customer Buying Patterns
- Analyzing transaction data to identify rules/patterns in customer purchasing behavior.
- Determine associations between products using market basket analysis to optimize menu offerings.

3. AI Recommender System: Enhance Customer Experience
- Developed a recommender system for menu items based on customer preferences.

4. Analytics Dashboard Development: Provide Comprehensive Business Insights
- Create a dynamic dashboard that consolidates insights from customer reviews, competitor analysis, and market basket analysis.
- Visualize key performance indicators, customer sentiment trends, and sales patterns for quick decision-making.

5. Sales Analysis:
- Examine sales data to pinpoint intervals with reduced transaction activity, such as during extended weekends when patrons usually travel to other cities, and communicate these findings to the management. This information can then be utilized to launch targeted seasonal promotions.
- Also peruse purchases data and see how those insights can be used in these targeted seasonal promotions.
